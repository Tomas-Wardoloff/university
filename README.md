# University Management System

This project is a web-based system designed to manage various aspects of a university, including student enrollment, course management, and degree tracking. It provides a centralized platform for administrators, faculty, and students to interact and access important information related to academic activities.

The idea is to build this project to learn and improve my backend knowledge and have real projects to show. 
This is the roadmap, that I am following to become a backend developer: [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend)

## Features

- Student registration and management
- Course management (creation, update, deletion)
- Degree tracking (monitoring student progress towards graduation)
- Enrollment management (enrolling students in courses and degree programs)
- User authentication and authorization (admin, faculty, student roles)

## Technologies Used

- Python: 3.12.2
- Django: Python web framework for backend development
- PostgreSQL: Relational database management system for data storage
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for user interface development
- Django REST Framework: Optional for building RESTful APIs
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Authentication mechanism for securing API endpoints
